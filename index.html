                                Patients undergoing joint replacements, heart surgeries, or orthopedic procedures benefit greatly from prehabilitation. 
                                Exercises focus on flexibility, strength, and breathing techniques to ensure a smoother post-surgery experience. 
                                It reduces recovery time and improves overall surgical outcomes.
